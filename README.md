Improved copypasting from PDFs and common websites into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

This plugin works by modifying the default paste function, meaning you do not have to use a separate paste function. You can simply use `cmd/ctrl + v` as you always do.

<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->

## General Modifications
- Left-over hyphenation or useless footnote references (e.g. when copying from a PDF) are removed.
- Two or more consecutive blank lines are reduced to one blank line.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is removed.

## Modifications for Specific Content Types
‚ÑπÔ∏è *Note that __Pasta Copinara__ respects the core Obsidian setting `Auto Convert HTML`, meaning that the following modifications will not take place if that setting is disabled.*
- Messages copypasted from the Discord app will be cleaned up. If the timestamp contains a relative date in English ("Today at‚Ä¶"), it will be replaced with the absolute date.
- Tweets copied from the Twitter website will be cleaned up.

## Commands added
- `Paste as Plain Text without Modifications`: Utility Command which pastes the clipboard content as plain text and without any modifications. Also circumvents pasting-modifications from other plugins like [Auto Link Title](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-auto-link-title).

## Limitations
The plugin only works with the standard pasting (`cmd/ctrl + v`) shortcut, and not with the pasting in vim's `p`. (Pasting with `cmd/ctrl + v` in normal or insert mode does work though.)

## Installation
Right now, the plugin is still in beta. It can be installed with the [BRAT Plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

When published, it will be available in Obsidian's Community Plugin Browser via: `Settings` ‚Üí `Community Plugins` ‚Üí `Browse` ‚Üí Search for *"Pasta Copinara"*

## Contribute
Adding to more pasting formatting to [`clipboardConversions.ts`](clipboardConversions.ts) should be fairly straightforward and self-contained; to add some formatting rules, basic JavaScript and Regex suffice.

Please use the [`.eslintrc` configuration located in the repository](.eslintrc) and run eslint before doing a pull request, and please do *not* use `prettier`. üôÇ

```shell
# Run eslint fixing most common mistakes
eslint --fix *.ts
```

## Credits
Thanks to [@zolrath](https://github.com/zolrath) for the [Auto-Link Title Plugin](https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title) which showed me how to modify paste events correctly.
