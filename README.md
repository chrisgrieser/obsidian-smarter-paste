Various improvements for when you copypaste things into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

This plugin works by modifying the default paste function, meaning you can simply continue using `cmd/ctrl + v` as you always did.

<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->

## Modifications
- Leftover hyphenation and footnote references (e.g. when copying from PDFs) are removed.
- Two or more consecutive blank lines are reduced to one blank line; leading and trailing whitespace is removed.
- If you paste a list item into a line that already has list syntax, the "double list syntax" that would normally occur (`- - some item`) is fixed. The same is done for markdown task syntax (`- [ ]`).
- If the cursor is in a blockquote or callout when the pasting and the clipboard contains multi-line content, the appropriate syntax will be applied to all lines pasted.

‚ÑπÔ∏è *Note that __Pasta Copinara__ respects the Obsidian setting `Auto Convert HTML`.*

## Commands added
- `Paste as Plain Text without Modifications`: Utility Command which pastes the clipboard content as plain text and without any modifications. Also circumvents pasting-modifications from other plugins like [Auto Link Title](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-auto-link-title).

## Limitations
- The plugin only works with the standard pasting (`cmd/ctrl + v`) shortcut, and not with the `p` operator in vim. (Pasting with `cmd/ctrl + v` in normal or insert mode does work though.)
- To avoid conflicts with Plugins like [Auto Link Title](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-auto-link-title) or [Paste URL into Selection](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=url-into-selection), *Pasta Copinara* will not be triggered when an URL is detected in the clipboard. 

## Installation
Right now, the plugin is still in beta. It can be installed with the [BRAT Plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

When published, it will be available in Obsidian's Community Plugin Browser via: `Settings` ‚Üí `Community Plugins` ‚Üí `Browse` ‚Üí Search for *"Pasta Copinara"*

## Contribute
Adding more rules to [`clipboardConversions.ts`](clipboardConversions.ts) should be fairly straightforward and self-contained. To add new formatting rules, basic JavaScript and Regex should be enough.

Please use the [`.eslintrc` configuration located in the repository](.eslintrc) and run eslint before doing a pull request, and please do *not* use `prettier`. üôÇ

```shell
# Run eslint fixing most common mistakes
eslint --fix *.ts
```
